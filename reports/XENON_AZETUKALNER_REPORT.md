## 6. Potential Acquirers

| Acquirer | Fit Score | Rationale | Est. Offer |
|----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **UCB** | 88 | Epilepsy specialist, Keppra genericization | $5-8B |
| **Jazz Pharma** | 85 | CNS focus, thin pipeline | $4.5-7B |

| **Biogen** | 78 | CNS pivot, diversification | $5-9B |
| **J&J** | 75 | Neuroscience unit | $6-10B |

### Most Likely Acquirer: **UCB**
- Strongest strategic fit (epilepsy focus)
- Faces Keppra generic competition
- Has acquisition capacity
- European buyer avoids some US antitrust scrutiny

---

## 7. Deal Probability Assessment

| Timeframe | Probability |
|-----------|-------------|
| 12 months | 35% |
| 24 months | 55% |

### Key Catalysts That Could Trigger Acquisition

1. **Positive X-TOLE2 data** (Q1 2026) - Highest impact
2. **FDA NDA acceptance** (Q3-Q4 2026)
3. **MDD Phase 3 data** (if positive, could trigger bidding war)

### Estimated Deal Value

| Scenario | Value | Premium to Current |
|----------|-------|-------------------|
| Floor | $4.5B | 60% |
| Base Case | $6.5B | 130% |
| Bull Case | $10.0B | 260% |

---

## 8. Key Risks

1. **Phase 3 FOS trial failure** - Binary event risk
2. **MDD indication** has lower PoS (35%)
3. **Kv7 safety** - Historical ezogabine retinal issues (different compound)
4. **Commercial execution** - First-time launcher
5. **Competition** from other novel AEDs

---

## 9. Investment Thesis

### Bull Case
- First-in-class Kv7 mechanism addresses unmet need
- Strong OLE data (90.9% seizure reduction)
- MDD indication could be transformational ($2B+ peak)
- Multiple strategic acquirers interested
- Current valuation ($2.8B) well below rNPV ($6B+)

### Bear Case
- Phase 3 failure risk remains significant
- Depression indications are higher risk (35% PoS)
- No revenue until 2027 at earliest
- Requires commercial build-out

---

## 10. Recommendation Summary

**For Forecast Review:**

| Line Item | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
|-----------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Revenue | 0 | 0 | 150M | 500M | 1.0B | 1.8B |
| R&D | 200M | 180M | 150M | 130M | 120M | 150M |
| SG&A | 50M | 100M | 200M | 250M | 300M | 450M |
| Net Income | (250M) | (280M) | (200M) | 120M | 580M | 1.2B |
| Cash | 691M | 411M | 211M | 331M | 911M | 2.1B |

**Key Questions for Review:**
1. Are the peak sales estimates reasonable by indication?
2. Is the FOS 55% PoS appropriate given OLE data?
3. Should MDD PoS be higher given novel mechanism?
4. What SG&A ramp is needed for launch?
5. Is the $6.5B base case acquisition value realistic?
